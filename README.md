### About
Created by Charles Bolton, [Chad M. Tolleson](https://github.com/tollesonpdx), and [Tom Lancaster](https://github.com/tlan2) in November 2019, Trivia Night is full-stack trivia game application. The idea was inspired by one of Tom's friend's love of pub trivia, Chad's near-daily practice of asking trivia questions on Slack, and Charlie's experience playing several other trivia applications. In short, everyone loves trivia. 

Trivia Night uses a PEN stack (Postgresql, Express, Node) and is currently hosted on heroku. The database allows for keeping track of high scores for the leaderboard, managing sign-up, sign-in, and other account funtionality, and eventually will manage head-to-head storage logic. The express app manages the database connection, routing, and other middleware. 

Styling was created using Bootstrap and CSS grid. 

Finally, a shout out and thank you to [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/) for their API. Trivia Night uses this database to generate game questions and custom games based on question number, difficulty and category.
